# m323 - Haskell and Functional Programming

This repository contains my weekly tasks and exercises for the m323 module on Haskell and functional programming.

## Structure

The repository is organized by weeks, with each week containing its own set of tasks and exercises:

```
m323/
├── week01/          # Week 1 tasks
├── week02/          # Week 2 tasks
├── week03/          # Week 3 tasks
└── ...
```

Each week folder will contain:
- Haskell source files (`.hs`)
- Task descriptions or documentation
- Any additional resources or notes

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the Haskell programs in this repository, you'll need:
- GHC (Glasgow Haskell Compiler)
- Cabal or Stack (build tools)

### Running Programs

To compile and run a Haskell file:
```bash
ghc filename.hs
./filename
```

Or use the interactive interpreter:
```bash
ghci filename.hs
```

## Progress

Tasks will be added week by week as the course progresses.
